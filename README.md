# Turtle Crossing Game

## Overview
The Turtle Crossing Game is a fun and interactive game where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The objective is to guide the turtle from the bottom to the top of the screen without getting hit by any cars.

This game is built using Python and the Turtle graphics package, which provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating graphics and animations.

## Features
- Player controls a turtle that can move up.
- Cars move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds.
- Each successful crossing increases the game's difficulty by speeding up the cars.
- Collision detection to check if the turtle is hit by a car.
- Score tracking for each successful crossing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle package (usually included with Python's standard library)

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Running the Game
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
3. Run the game by executing:
   ```bash

   ```

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the turtle:
  - Up arrow: Move up
- Avoid the cars as you make your way to the top of the screen.
- Each time you successfully cross the road, the game will become more challenging with faster cars.

## Code Structure
- `main.py`: Main game script that sets up the game and runs the game loop.
- `player.py`: Contains the Player class that handles turtle movements.
- `car_manager.py`: Contains the Car class that handles car movements and collision detection.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the Scoreboard class that tracks and displays the player's score.

## Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game, such as:
- Turtle speed and starting position.
- Car speed, color, and frequency.
- Screen dimensions and background.

To customize, open the respective `.py` files and modify the variables as desired.
